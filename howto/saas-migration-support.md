# Migrating to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric
{: #migrating-to-hlf-support}

Customers who are currently operating and using {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform networks, either on-prem (software) or on IBM Cloud (SaaS), are being advised of the eventual migration of both environments to the existing IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric on-prem (software) offering, which is a close relative of both IBM Blockchain Platform offerings.

**Target audience:** This topic is designed for network and system administrators who are responsible for planning, configuring and migrating {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} networks.


## What is happening?
{: #ibp-migration-what}

In September, 2021, IBM released the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric edition, which provides certified images of Hyperledger Fabric open source code, accelerators, and IBM support for Fabric-based blockchain solutions. Given the functional overlap with the IBM Blockchain Platform Software and SaaS editions, IBM will be withdrawing the IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS edition in July, 2023.

## Why is it happening?
{: #ibp-migration-why}

To maintain a focused development, delivery & support effort for IBM Blockchain Platform, it has been determined that the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric Support  best recognizes the opensource foundation of the core code and aligns IBMâ€™s value with the support, certification, and accelerators.

## How to transition licensing?
{: #ibp-migration-licensing}

IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS PayGo customers can transition their license to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric during any month, without any existing long-term customer commitment, through coordination with their IBM Blockchain Support team or IBM Account Representative.

IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS subscription customers will be able to transition their license to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric at the end of their current subscription commitment, or before July, 2023 (whichever comes first), with assistance from their IBM Blockchain Support team or IBM Account Representative.

## Planning and Considerations
{: #ibp-migration-planning}

IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric supports the Hyperledger Fabric v2.x codebase (the v1.4 codebase goes out of support in April, 2023) so existing environments need to utilize v2.x component images.

Documentation for the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric is a current IBM product offering; the [documentation is available at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hlf-support/1.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hlf-support/1.0.0).

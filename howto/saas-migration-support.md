# Migrating to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric
{: #migrating-to-hlf-support}

Customers who are currently operating and using {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform (IBP) network Software as a Service (SaaS) edition **must migrate their environment to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric by July 31, 2023.** This document, along with step-by-step guidance in your console interface, describe how to complete the migration, which will have no impact on your existing data or blockchain network functionality.
{: shortdesc}

**Target audience:** This topic is designed for network and system administrators who are responsible for planning, configuring and migrating {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} networks.


## What is changing?
{: #ibp-migration-what}

In September, 2021, IBM released the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric edition, which provides certified images of Hyperledger Fabric open source code, accelerators, and IBM support for Fabric-based blockchain solutions. Given the functional overlap with the IBM Blockchain Platform Software and SaaS editions, IBM will be withdrawing the IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS edition on July 31, 2023. The [IBM Cloud service withdrawal announcement](https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/1/897/ENUS922-101/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en) was published on July 26, 2002.


## Why is it changing?
{: #ibp-migration-why}

To maintain a focused development, delivery & support effort for IBM Blockchain Platform, it has been determined that the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric Support  best recognizes the opensource foundation of the core code and aligns IBMâ€™s value with the support, certification, and accelerators.


## How do I transition my license?
{: #ibp-migration-licensing}

IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS PayGo customers can transition their license to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric during any month, without any existing long-term customer commitment, through coordination with their IBM Blockchain Support team or IBM Account Representative.

IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS subscription customers will be able to transition their license to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric at the end of their current subscription commitment, or before July 31, 2023 (whichever comes first), with assistance from their IBM Blockchain Support team or IBM Account Representative.


## Planning and Considerations
{: #ibp-migration-planning}

IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric supports the Hyperledger Fabric v2.x codebase (the v1.4 codebase goes out of support in April, 2023) so existing environments need to utilize v2.x component images.

Documentation for the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric is a current IBM product offering; the [documentation is available at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hlf-support/1.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hlf-support/1.0.0).


## Next steps
{: #ibp-migration-next-steps}

A tool will be provided that migrates your IBM Blockchain Platform console from an IBM-hosted environment to your Kubernetes cluster. Before running this tool, your Kubernetes cluster must be preconfigured with the required Hyperledger Fabric blockchain components, which are your peers, ordering nodes, and certificate authorities. As part of this process, the images used for these components will be switched to images provided for IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric.

While IBM is testing this migration tool internally for production usage, **there are steps you can take now** to prepare for your migration to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric, as follows:

    1. Upgrade any blockchain components that are using Hyperledger Fabric v1.4:

        - Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 will **NOT** be supported by IBM Blockchain Platform **after March 31, 2023**. Blockchain components must be upgraded to at least Hyperledger Fabric v2.2 **before March 31, 2023**.
        - [Instructions for upgrading from Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 to Hyperledger Fabric v2.2 are available here.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern-components#ibp-console-govern-components-upgrade-v14-v22)

    2. Make sure that the Kubernetes version meets the following minimum requirements for migration:

       - Your existing IBM Kubernetes Service must be at version 1.23 or 1.24. Note that the version should be upgraded to 1.24 **before April 26, 2023**, when [support ends for version 1.23](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
       - If your existing network is running on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the OCP version must be 4.9, 4.10, or 4.11.

    3. Make sure that your Hyperledger Fabric v2.2 or v2.4 components are at the prerequisite levels required for migration:

       - Hyperledger Fabric v2.2 components must be at the following levels:
          a) peers - v2.2.10 or higher
          b) ordering nodes - v2.2.10 or higher
          c) certificate authorities - v1.5.5 or higher

       - Hyperledger Fabric v2.4 components must be at the following levels:
          a) peers - v2.4.8 or higher
          b) ordering nodes - v2.4.8 or higher
          c) certificate authorities - v1.5.5 or higher


Note: Once available, the migration tool will verify these prerequisites from your console.
